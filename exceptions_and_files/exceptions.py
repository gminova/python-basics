# Exceptions

# Different exceptions are raised for different reasons.
# Common exceptions:
# ImportError: an import fails
# IndexError: a list is indexed with an out-of-range number
# NameError: an unknown variable is used
# SyntaxError: the code can't be parsed properly
# TypeError: a function is called on a value of an inappropriate type
# ValueError: a function is called on a value of the correct type, but with an inappropriate value.
# Python has several other built-in exceptions, such as ZeroDivisionError and OSError. Third-party libraries also often define their own exceptions.
